## Data Mining for Beginners

We know that programming can be a barrier for many who are fascinated by text and data mining. Therefore, we are hosting a course on the program Orange.

Orange is a user-friendly software for text and data mining, and the great thing about Orange is that you can use it without needing to know how to program. We call this type of program ‘no-code’ software.

The course is recommended if you want to understand how data, such as digital texts and images, can be transformed and analysed by a computer. In this way the course is relevant for both students and researchers who will be using or assessing digital methods and results.  

Orange can handles many of the same tasks and processes that are integrated parts of the concepts of data science that typically is applied to different fields of studies within both natural, social and humanistic science.  

On the course you can learn:  
- Data collection of news articles  
- Preprocessing before analysis   
- Analysis and categorization - both texts and images   
- Visualisation

Orange is installed on six computers in KUB Datalab at South Campus. If you wish to use your own computer, then before the course, we ask you to download and install the program. [Click here to go to the download page.](https://orangedatamining.com/download/)
